# Wordcheater

`Wordcheater` is a simple web app designed to give a helping hand to players of [Wordscape](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peoplefun.wordcross&hl=en_IE&gl=US) games, when their hearts are broken by the final word. The user enters all the letters on the word wheel, and then the pattern of letters in the word that she can't find. She then hits the button, and all permutations are listed.

`Wordcheater` is also an opportunity for me to practice a little of `Python Flash`, and to see how [Render](https://render.com/) compares with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) in terms of app hosting solutions.
